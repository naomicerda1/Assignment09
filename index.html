    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>What worked well for you over the last 9 weeks that aided in your learning process?</li>
            <p>What worked well for me over the last 9 weeks that helped me understand and grasp the class was to read and take my own note prior to attending the lecture, as well as take as much notes while the lecture was being given.</p><br>
        <li>What would you change about the course?</li>
            <p>The only thing that I could think of to change about the course is to possibly give the lecture a bit slower. I know time was of the essence and the power point slides were posted on canvas, but there could be questions to come to mind at the moment and then slip away cause students are too busy trying to hear the professor and write notes and once the student tried to think of something, their mind could go blank.</p><br>
        <li>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</li>
            <p>I learned more than I expected to in this course. I feel that if I would have been able to attend class regularly, I could have learned so much more of the difficult stuff. But I enjoyed the creative side of CSS.</p><br>
        <li>What concepts were new to you and what concepts had you already encountered in the past?</li>
            <p>I had taken an internet programming course back in 2010 and I remember making websites and adding text along with images. Although, i'm sure I learned much more, I cannot remember most of it. Point is, the majority that I learned in this course was new to me. From making git repositories to creating forms and making pages friendly to those with disabilities. This course was a great start to the program and I am excited to see what else is in store to learn!</p><br>
